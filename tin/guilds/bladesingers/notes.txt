<BS> Xiu : so here's my standard unsolicited advice for the new folks on
training: train freeform and combat strategies and gadvance to
glevel 5. train those two skills however much you feel like on
teh way to 5. at 5 switch to combat abilities and acrobatics,
till you get dodge (check bcmds all, not skills). toggle dodge
on. then on to glevel 15, while thinking about what weapon you
want to use for the next 90 combat days.
