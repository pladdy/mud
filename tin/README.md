# tt++ files

Tintin files are stored in different directories in an attempt to organize them
by a theme.

## utilities

There are 'utilities' available when playing.  These are (for the most part) in the form of
tintin aliases that are created when you create a session and start to play.  You can read
about useful commands in the sub-directories mentioned below.

While in the game, you can use `aliases guild` to see guild related aliases.

Use `aliases default` to see ALL non-guild aliases.
