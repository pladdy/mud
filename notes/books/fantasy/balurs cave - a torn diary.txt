'...We have just finished the ring of stones and
everybody is very excited. If we have succeeded
we will perhaps be able to defeat the vampires
that have started to attack our homes...'

The rest of the passage has been torn away but
further down the page there are a few more sentences
that are legible.

'...Power has started to build up but something doesn't
seem quite right. We have discussed it but nobody wants
to stop the process...

'...A strange portal opened up. I have a very bad feeling
about this so I'm writing down everything that happens in
case...no one remains to tell the story later...'

The text on this page is written with another handwriting
than before...

'Balur asked me to write this down as an account of what
has happened here today and will happen...
Demons poured out of the portal and immediately attacked
us. We fled down to these caves and managed to hold them
back but now they are attacking again...'

The last words are barely legible and blood covers the
rest of the page.
