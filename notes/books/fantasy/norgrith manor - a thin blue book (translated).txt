Over the years, many people have become fascinated with the
construction of mazes.  They have intrigued people interested
in engineering, puzzles, and magic.  I am one of those people
and have spent a great deal of my time exploring some of the
the world's most famous mazes.  I have mapped many of them and
described them in this book for your enjoyment.  Please note
that some of these pictures are quite old and are perhaps a bit out
of date.

Hamgrom Manor Hedge Maze:

This maze is one of the simplest that I have encountered.
It is quite pretty with plush ivy walls and beautiful
rose bushes along the exterior.  Unlike some mazes, there
is little danger of getting hopelessly lost.

This maze was one of the first to incorporate the use of
magic into the design.  There are several portals that
make navigation quite difficult despite the simple layout
of the maze.

This unorthodox maze was the first to not adopt the
traditional square shape.  It is quite beautiful and
there is little danger of getting very lost.  I highly
recommend visiting the manor and this maze if one is
traveling in the area.

The Norgrith Manor maze is one of the most feared
mazes in the Eastern Kingdoms.  In has numerous portals
that are hidden and require finding if one is to
reach the center of the maze, which has a beautiful
fountain and a statue dedicated to the ancestors
of the family.  It is rumored that the bushes of
the walls have been animated due to a mis-cast
spell.  I have not been here in over 10 years so I can not say for sure.

Dwarfs have always been the worlds finest engineers
but this underground system of tunnels was not one of their better jobs.
A few years after its construction, many of the ceilings began
collapsing under their weight and the entrance had to be sealed.
The entrance was reopened by an mysterious group of thieves
who soon after deserted it as well.  I am aware of nobody entering
since then.

This maze started out as a prison for dangerous convicts.
It consists of a network of cells and torture chambers
and is quite an eerie place.  Now visited only by the
most inquisitive travelers, it can provide quite a thrill
if that is what you are looking for.

This book represents only a small fraction of the mazes of the
Eastern Kingdoms and is by no means a definitive guide. It
is simply designed to be an overview for the inquisitive
traveler to examine some of the more interesting mazes.
You are at the end of the book.
