                        BRAIN TRANSPLANT PROCEDURE
                        by: Victor Mordenheim, MD

1) First, you must...constrain your patient.  The performance of a highly
   delicate procedure such as this depends critically on the stillness of
   the donor.

2) When the patient is isolated and constrained, you may incise or cut the
   skull.  This requires a sharp, precision instrument such as a scalpel.
   A long vertical slice is all that is necessary to expose the brain--be
   careful not to cut too deeply or you may injure the donor organ.

3) With the skull open and the brain exposed, quickly sever the spinal
   cord of the patient.  A scalpel is a sloppy instrument for this job,
   because the connection of the brain stem to the nerves of the neck and
   back are thick.  A bone cutter or similar instrument is recommended.
   Mere cutting will not suffice, the cord must be carefully severed.

4) Finally, the brain must be extracted from the body.  This requires a
   specimen bag or other sterile container.  The sterility of the container
   is crucial to the survival of the brain prior to transplant...

The rest of the page is too faded to read.  You mumble to yourself,
Sounds simple!  Maybe I should become a mad scientist!
 
        You shrug that off as a bad idea and move on...
