Page 1: Who are the Horde?

Herein follows the account of The Horde…
The smoke and dust began to settle across the bloodied fields of battle.
Cries of anguish echoed throughout the land, lamenting the loss of family,
slain by the evil that haunts the darkest reaches of our souls.  This was
declared the age of Mage Wars, a time when life was perilous and
treacherous.  Not knowing whom to trust, friends became enemies, brothers
spilt each other’s blood, and everywhere people suspected their neighbors
of siding with or becoming influenced by the evil.  The Dark Mages, the
mere thought of their names gripped at ones worst fears and tightened a
stranglehold on ones courage.  Where the cadavers of fallen heroes were
strewn about the landscape, evil seemed destined to declare victory over
the light.

Out of the ashes came forth two glimmers of hope.  Sworn to brotherhood
long ago, before the time of strife, Korat and Raid began their search
across the countryside.  They knew the peril mankind faced, for they
clashed with it at every town and field.  They sought for people with
skills of the highwaymen who could join them in their fight against the
aftermath of ruin.

Finding reprise at Chapel, seemingly uneventful for the moment, the two
brigands heard of one other undertaking great deeds of theivery.
Stories were told of these strangers, stories that spoke of true thieves,
and the mettle needed to defeat the poverty.  Korat and Raid sought out
these Masterful souls, and offered their pledge of brotherhood to the
guild known as The Horde.  It was learned that Raid was highly skilled in
the ways of Leadership, while Korat was adept as procuring trouble within
the Horde.  Korat decided that the most fearful evil has the horde itself
and fled into the Chapel Forest.

There is a large city located in Chapel filled with backstabbers and
corruption of all kinds.  You do not want to end up there.  They kill
you with their honeyed words and fill you with dreams of wealth.
Anything goes in that lawless city.  I won't even speak its name for it
is associated with Anarchy, Thieves, and Liars.

Page 3:  Chapel Forest

The Chapel Forest is a vast area of dense woods lying in the great saddle
of land between the Chapel Mountains and Wayhaven.  Covering an area of
nearly 100,000 square miles, whole nations could be lost within this great
region.  As indeed, there are.

The vast forest is actually many different regions.  The north is a land
of mighty grasslands and tall mountains that is home to many brigands.
In the forest, a small guild of thieves struggles with the Horde and
intelligent fairies amidst the fog-bound stands of maple and nightshade.

Page 4:  Chapel Grasslands

Chaple's vast, open plains are a relatively harsh environment, blanketing
much of its interior and much of the northen pass.  Gentle hills and
small copses or groves are the only thing to break up an otherwise
rolling landscape, and most encounters can not be seen from some distance
away.  Grassland is only slightly more difficult than travel by road,
though the open terrain makes it easy to get lost when no landmarks are
available.  These grasslands are inhabited by the Horde, a small group
of brigands led by a Demigod.

Page 5:  Chapel Pass

This maze-like mountain pass, which serves as the boundary between the
grassland and the Uttermost North to Shadowchapel, has many of the
highest peaks in Fantasy.  The mountains here, thanks to the altitude
as well as the sub-arctic climate, remain snow-capped throughout the
year.  The mountain range is also known as 'The Wall' since it is
nearly impassable in most places.  Though once extensively populated
by dwarves who built numerous strongholds and cities amongst their
length, the pass is now largely home to fierce, cold-dwelling monsters.
Clans of hill giants roam its foothills, while frost giants, yeti,
white dragons, and taer claim the high peaks and valleys.  It also
contains some of the richest mineral deposits in the North, including
iron, lead, gold, silver, and mithral.  Much of the heart of the
mountain range is unexplored.

Few other civilized folk are found here other than Brigands for the
Horde, The Silent Knife, and the occasional merchant from Shadowchapel.
Legend has it that an ancient white dragon and his bronze dragon
companion roam the mountains pass in the guise of an old hunter and
his hound.

Page 6: Lord Raid

In Fantasy,
the Deities stood pondering, overwhelmed by the mess caused by the Mage Wars.
'In this world, is there any soul that can extirpate all this ruin?' they
wondered.  'May this one, if he exists, reveal to us before the cancerous
decay reaches the eternal skies.' As the sole candidate prepared to stand
before the Deities, the poverty was spreading out across the land, plunging
the world of the mortals into turmoil.

Chaos, panic of starvation overgrowing beyond control, soiling all the
kingdoms across the breadth of the realm.  Demons, monsters and people,
killing and stealing without remorse.  Fading more, day after day, the
precarious flame of hope.

And the Deities looked out from their temples to a world falling into decay.
The balance from the forces of law and chaos was crumbling away.  And they
thought the time had come to draw out the pernicious poison.  To close the
circle once more and annihilate their creation.
But came up a Diety, who was the great Watcher of mankind. 'Please change
your minds.' he said,'Below still live powerful mortals.  Amongst them
stands a sole leader, who is my strongest worshipper.  The Sphinx he
defeated, the dragon he slayed, the bounty he steals from creedy hands.'

And the immortals looked past their altars to the deeds of the sole hero.
They believed that his will was worth the confidence of the Deities.
And they thought the time had come to pass on their divine power.  To
grant the power of godhood once more and restore harmony in this world.

And Raid looked up to the edge of the sky,  perceived the divine sign
in the depths of his heart.

A celestal vortex appeared, a portal that seemed to touch the sky.
The Brigand looked exhausted while entering its vast swirling rings, but
he managed to endure one by one the votex rings before coming back with
the powers of a immortal.  The young Brigand stood amazed.  'The most
powerful sword shall ever be nothing more than a vulgar piece of steel.'
he said.  The Deities knew with those words a mistake had been made.

Page 7:  Korat of the Silent Knife

Then Korat came.  A cunning and sly person he was, the commoner actually
served under Raid his friend as a soldier.  Doing just enough to get by
without being slain, he grew sick of horde life, and set out to find this
Thieves clan, having heard rumors of such a place amongst the other
grunts in the horde.  Weeks he roamed the many paths of Chapel, and no
signs of the place ever revealed itself.  Sometimes, Korat felt as if he
was traveling in circles, and soon he was hopelessly lost.  One day, Korat
was resting in a tree, weary and worn he was, the forest itself seemed to
be eating away at his moral.  Until upon fate's chance, he suddenly
noticed a silent figure creeping along the forest floor.  The figure was
cloaked in black, and walked with subtle movements, his feet hardly
making a noise upon the ground.  Korat edged silently along the branches
that loomed above the dark figure.  Assuming this person was some black
guard Raid had sent to track down Korat, seeing as he deserted the horde,
the foot soldier slowly drew out a dagger.  Narrowing his eyes, he leapt
from the branch, falling down upon the cloaked figure and driving his
dagger into his back.  The person was slain instantly and fell limp on the
ground.

Korat gathered himself and turned the corpse over, discovering the person
was actually a elf.  He searched his belongings, taking his gold, and
discovering a small parchment.  Too Korat's delight, the parchment was
infact a map, with exact directions to the Thieves hideout.  Korat
discarded his dirty and worn clothes, and took the elves cloak and other
belongings.  Feeling refreshed and wearing new, comfortable clothes,
Korat set out with a determined demeanor to find the elusive Thieves
clan.  Another week of wandering, and trying to read the map, Korat
found more than he bargained for.  Discovering the clan, he was quite
amazed, though that amazement turned to rage as he was captured as soon
as he stepped into view.  Assassins, and thieves brought him into the
hall, and presented him before several elite looking clan members.
Donned in lavish clothing, they were obviously the leaders of the clan.
Korat soon learned otherwise.

To his astonishment, he had actually slain the Master Thief of the
Silent Knife.  The council of Expert Thieves immediately recognized
this, seeing as Korat wore the Master's clothes, and the fact the
Master disappeared. Also, to his utter disbelief, under clan law, he
who can slay the Master shall become the new Master.  Thus, Korat
was christened thier ruler that day.  It didn't take long for him to
settle into the life of the thieves clan, and he was soon plotting
ways to take advantage of Raid's horde.  As time passed Korat went
missing soon after Raid was made a immortal , nobody knows if he is
still alive or dead.

A note

The story of the Thiel'feyn Longbow goes something like this.  A long
time ago in Shadowchapel the dark mage Elindull-Rah posed a challenge
to the dippers (pickpockets) of that town.  He had just completed his
tower, and promised untold riches to any dipper, who could
penetrate its defences and steal his treasure.  Many tried and
failed, falling victim to his varied traps.  The mage was jovial
about the whole deal and cured most of the thieves cheerfully,
when they failed.  Eventually a relatively unknown dipper,
Thiel'feyn, collected information from those that had returned
from the tower and managed to reach the mage's treasure room.
Feeling confident, Thiel'feyn raided the treasure room and left town.
When the mage finally hunted him down, he congratulated him on his
skills and took him prisoner.  He proceeded to chop off Thiel'feyn's
arms and enchanted them to forge the bow.  Thiel'feyn was never
seen again, and to this day it is still called the 'Thiel'feyn Longbow'.
                                                                  
Scribed in messy unknown handwriting

The bow is here in Chapel, but where....I must find..it
