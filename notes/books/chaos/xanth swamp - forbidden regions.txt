You take the book off the shelf and peruse it a bit.
It seems there are a set of regions south of the Fen
called the Forbidden Regions, the Void, Earth, Water,
Fire and Air. Noone travels through them because they
are very dangerous and contain some nasty beasts.
Lucky for you, you've found this book to help you navigate
the regions. It says in one passage that to go from the
Void region to the Earth region, you must 'enter' the wall
of earth which separates them. To go from Earth to either
the Void or Water, you just travel in the direction you want
to go. From Water to Earth you must dig through the muddy
wall, and from Water to Fire, you must burn. From Fire to
Water you simply immerse yourself, while from Fire to Air
you fly. From Air to Fire, you must burn.
