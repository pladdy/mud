Book of thingy making:

Written in some generic year by a little green gnome with blue eyes and
a long pointy black beard.  Now if you believe that such a creature
exists, then you should have no problem believing what is in this book.
Of course, this book was copy written the year you were born so you
have no chance of plagiarizing it or making profit from it anyway.
Then again, you could sell the book and make a profit, thus making that
statement a complete lie.  Anyway, enclosed in this book are the exact
details of how to make a thingy.  Now what you do with your thingy is
your personal business, and honestly, nobody else wants to know unless
they are a sick pervert like the little green gnome who wrote this
book.

                                    Sincerely, 

                                    A little gnome named Joiry

The making of a thingy is an exact science.  It takes all the right
materials and preparations for a thingy to be successfully made.
Chaotic forces are at hand in making a thingy and if you don't have all
the proper materials, then all kinds of random reactions could happen.
In most cases it's best not to make a thingy at all, since life does go
on without them.  It is rumored that using a thingy can be highly
addictive and the loss of one can cause illness or even death.  These
rumors have never been proven or disproven or even verified.  But, they
are rumors nonetheless.  Who knows, you could turn into a little
perverted gnome or something.  It's best to turn back now.

In making a thingy you need a thin band of pure silver wire.  Of
course, thingys have been made without pure silver and even other kinds
of wire have been substituted in the past, but remember that making a
thingy is an exact science, and you must have pure silver wire or
something remotely similar to silver, like coal.  Pure coal is
necessary to ensure that no chaotic forces happen, it would be best to
make sure that the thingy has pure silver for its binding material.
Aluminum has often been substituted for silver in the binding of a
thingy.  Even though they have very little in common on a physical or
chemical basis, they are both a silvery color and that's all that
really counts in the scheme of the exact science of thingy making.

The base foundation of a thingy is wood.  Not any old wood, but very
old wood.  Any old wood just wouldn't do, but very old wood should be
just fine.  Be careful, it's hard to distinguish any old from very old
and you have to be quite a clever gnome to figure out which is which.
For best results, you MUST have an oak of at least a thousand years and
that has never seen daylight is necessary in making a thingy.  Many
have quested just to find the wood foundation for a thingy alone.  All
have died, so it's not recommended to do so, but the best thingys come
from thousand year old albino oak.  Should you not resolve your quest
to find thousand year old oak, then it would be best to use some other
kind of wood.  Black Marble could be used instead, but that might have
some cataclysmic results including turning you from gnome to a
beautiful human female with an insatiable thirst for sex.  Now that
would be a catastrophe now wouldn't it?

The beating heart of one who has lost their love is necessary to bring
power to the thingy and hold it together.  Love binds our souls with
one another, and this same power will bind the thingy together and hold
it for all eternity.  Love is strong and conquers all.  In preparation
for creating the thingy, you must fall in love and stay that way for a
period of seven years.  This will age the heart and forge the binding
love which will be used to bind the thingy.  Once the seven years has
passed, you must murder your loved one in cold blood and dig out your
own heart with a dull spoon.  Silver would be best as not to cause
infection.  You cannot use the heart of your loved one, as the love
will be lost upon striking the killing blow.  Once you have dug out
your beating heart, place it in a plastic baggie and seal it to keep
the air from ruining the freshness of the heart.  You might find
yourself a little light headed upon doing this.  This is perfectly
normal.  It happens to most.  You may even lose consciousness, in
which case, making a successful thingy isn't at issue, and you've
spoiled your seven-year love.  Should this happen, you'll have to find
some other glue to hold your thingy together.

Now, no thingy would be worth its salt without a golden soul in order 
to create its marvelous melody.  Perhaps it would be worth half a 
grain of salt but that just wouldn't do.  Salt could be necessary in 
the exact science of thingy making, but then again, what good is salt 
anyway.  Increasing blood pressure is often a bad thing, except when 
ripping out your own beating heart as is necessary in the exact science 
of thingy making.  A silver spoon has never been known to dig out a 
golden soul, but that really isn't the spoon's fault now is it? How does 
the spoon know the nature of one's soul?  Why do we pick on silver 
spoons anyway?  What's wrong with a bronze spoon?  I say that all of the 
the bronze spoons of this chaotic world should rise up and take note.  
March on the streets of the winding road and obliterate that stupid 
mushroom and earn some respect.  After all, the mushroom is biased 
towards those who don't have hands to clap.  Yeah, that's it, there is 
no golden soul and it's entirely the mushroom's fault!  Guess you're out 
of luck when it comes to thingy making.

Once you have gathered all the components of your thingy hold them
gently in one hand while using the other to read the scroll of thingy
making.  The scroll was made by the powerful Wiccan, Marvelous Marsha
of Mishaven Manor.  Only one scroll was ever made, so if there is a
thingy in existence, you are likely to be out of luck.  As with this
book, the scroll was copy written and any copies you obtain would be
forgeries, and punishable by law!  This gnome cannot be responsible for
the results of using a forged copy of the scroll of thingy making, and
when you turn into a frog and have to convince some bard to give you a
kiss to get your true form back, don't take it out on the poor,
innocent gnome population.  You have had fair warning.  Find the
scroll, read the scroll, make da thingy!
You are at the end of the book.
