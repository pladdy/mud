Summoning mage in Mage Tower

Defenses:
  Super high defense, like a mage.  Until you wear out his spell point pool he's
  fairly immune to all damage.

Strategy:
  Use lots of attacks.  It wears his sps down faster.  Also can use a guild power
  like bards cacaophany, monk serpent form, etc.

  For my gentech/cyber it's no problem as i just do multiple attacks.  On the gentech
  don't synergize (use 3 different dmg types).
