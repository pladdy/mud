They hurt, bad.

Lore:

  Tensor mandated that Riekl upgrade them in such a way to be anti-gentech, but also basically anti
  everyone on the mud.

Strategy/Notes:

  - you need to keep your average damage in the 800-1000/rnd total range
  - go much above that and they fury (it increases their damage dramatically)
    - fury stacks
  - go below or too high the avg dmg and they summon pedelings, 1 per round, up until 32 are in the
    room
    - pedelings range from 50k - 700k
  - if more than one pede is in the room with each other, they go beserk.  That was an anti-gen/jugger
    change, they used to stack pedes and kill 2 at a time.
  - if you hit them too hard too often, they dest

  When the pedes will randomly summon a stray pedeling or two it's in your interest to switch targets
  and kill it because when the pede gets < 20% hp, it will eat the pedeling for an hp heal.

  This interacts with another mechanic: when the pede hits 20%, it will emote a dark blue colored
  message about link to the plane fading.

  The number of rounds it takes you to get to the 20% mark defines the pace you have for the last 20%.
  If it heals, you don't make the pace.  Ideally, you would need the ability to ramp up damage after
  that message in order to secure a kill; without securing a kill, the pede will randomly dest.

Damage Notes:

  - mud damage is separate
  - average above or below 800-1k/rnd
    - hit too hard, they fury and do more dmg
    - hit too weak, they summon pedelings; you trigger the summoning of 1 pedeling/rnd ad infinitum;
      - it caps around 32 pedelings they range from 50k to 700kish
  - if you do too much dmg enough, they dest
    - Example: "Tempus spreads his arms apart, screaming in ultimate pain."

Guild Notes:

  Gentech note:

    - good rule of thumb, each 10% bias equates to about 100 dmg/rnd for your cap

  Cyborg notes:

    - as a corps, use 1 medium weapon with assault animus on
    - when you see the warning the pede is losing their link, add expansive hip augmentation to the fight
      - as a corps subguild, with assault animus on
        - can kill vestral with expansive hip augmentation
          - if i use EXA with a medium weapon he furies!
      - EXA + Medium dests the pedes and they fury over time
      - Need to try with a light and an EXA or two light weapons
    - some pedes can be deconstructed (wistana, solaris, vestral)

Big Pedes:

  Hydronius, Guardinal Mantid of water guards the path to bigpedes.
  - another mini area with pedes that grow as boot proceeds (like starcraft area)

Weird dir rooms:

  There's a trick to them: similar to the up/down at center of pedes the entrance can be blocked.
  - to enter some, their corresponding peded must be alive
  - these rooms are safe from pedes hunting you (not pedelings)
  - only open if corresponding pede is alive
  - hide here and aggro'd pedes/pedelings will die after X rounds

Specific Pede Notes:
  Azuria:

    - ice immune

  Pallatu:

    - immune to all but ice or acid

  Wistana:

    - edged/fire immune

  Sinder:

    - edged/fire/ice immune

Who blocks what?
- pedes in the e/s/w/n directions block down
- interior diagonals block up two of the up blockers require fire dmg
