Galmog the shrag

galmog reflects like sauk but not as much.  he also has a lot more hps and
regens more it seems

Class: ?

Strategy:
  use sword of wounding to counter his regen
  use 'panic' command to heal; this will heal when pheal doesn't fire (due to hit not being from
  mob?)

  gentech:
    use 3 dmg types to remove synergy (gentech)
    defenase bias 110, try 100 with panic next time
    * while he's wounded, you can surge out of combat :)

Items:
  elven jewel (?)
  hide of galmog (decent ac, reflects dmg)
