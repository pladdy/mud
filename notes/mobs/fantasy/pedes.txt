They hurt, bad.

Lore:
Tensor mandated that Riekl upgrade them in such a way to be anti-gentech, but also basically anti
everyone on the mud.

Strategy/Notes:
- ideally you need to keep your average damage in the 800-1000/rnd total range
- go much above that and they fury (it increases their damage dramatically)
- fury stacks
- go below or too high the avg dmg and they summon pedelings, 1 per round, up until 32 are in the
  room
- pedelings range from 50k - 700k
- if more than one pede is in the room with each other, they go beserk.  That was an anti-gen/jugger
  change, they used to stack pedes and kill 2 at a time.

When the pedes will randomly summon a stray pedeling or two it's in your interest to switch targets
and kill it because when the pede gets < 20% hp, it will eat the pedeling for an hp heal.

This interacts with another mechanic: when the pede hits 20%, it will emote a dark blue colored
message about link to the plane fading.

The number of rounds it takes you to get to the 20% mark defines the pace you have for the last 20%.
If it heals, you don't make the pace.  Ideally, you would need the ability to ramp up damage after
that message in order to secure a kill without securing a kill, the pede will randomly dest.

Gentech note:
- good rule of thumb, each 10% bias equates to about 100 dmg/rnd for your cap

Damage Notes:
- mud damage is separate
- average above or below 800-1k/rnd, you trigger the summoning of 1 pedeling/rnd ad infinitum;
  it caps around 32 pedelings they range from 50k to 700kish

Big Pedes:
Hydronius, Guardinal Mantid of water guards the path to bigpedes.
- another mini area with pedes that grow as boot proceeds (like starcraft area)

Weird dir rooms:
There's a trick to them: similar to the up/down at center of pedes the entrance can be blocked.
- to enter some, their corresponding peded must be alive
- these rooms are safe from pedes hunting you (not pedelings)
- only open if corresponding pede is alive
- hide here and aggro'd pedes/pedelings will die after X rounds

Specific Pede Notes:
Pallatu:
- mineral pede; only ice/acid dmg work

Who blocks what?
- pedes in the e/s/w/n directions block down
- interior diagonals block up two of the up blockers require fire dmg
