Dex:
Basically linearly continues to improve your damage avoidance
- some aspect of mob's size impacts it
- you can avoid hits entirely, up to 55.8% of incoming hits

The amount of dex + special melee defense required to hit 55.8% depends on the mob size.  You can
see hints of this on the score screen, the melee defense readout changes based on what mob size
you're fighting.

Strength/carrying capacity impacts this as well, above a certain level of burden it hinders your
ability to avoid attacks.

The way you can measure your avoidance is to turn off all brief on incoming mob melee hits
and count the number of complete misses from the mob, divide by total incoming attacks.

Reforging AC to SMD is almost always a good idea (from the ACs you don't care about).
- it's lossy, but adds non trivial damage avoidance

Wear your normal gear with reforged to defense and go measure against things you typically fight
see where you sit with % of hits that miss you, if it's < 55.8% over a long time period, raise your
dex experimentally, ~230 dex was my sweet spot.
