After killing Huge Terran Firebat:
A surge of powerful electricity runs screaming through your veins
as you see the limp corpse of the once mighty Firebat fall to the
floor.  Having bested such a formidable foe you have gained intimate
understanding of its defenses, its strengths, its weaknesses.  Having
tangled with such sophisticated alien technology has given you
confidence that you would be able to harness such technology
yourself... for a little while, at least.
