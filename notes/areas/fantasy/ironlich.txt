Area is marked as unknown but is in Tensor's Hell.

Gargoyles are ~30K and hunt
Ironlich is ~300k and hunts

Gargoyles drop spheres that provide overmax heal
Lich drops 8 sphers

Notes:
  spheres heal 35 hp overmax; can get 35 spheres
  if you leave the area and come back you can trigger a reset to double the gargoyles
  mobs are once per boot it seems
