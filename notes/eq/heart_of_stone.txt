Heart of stone (slightly cracked)
Heart of stone (badly cracked)

With a short, sharp snap the staff breaks into unusable fragments.
As the last bits of stone crumble into dust in your hands, you find
that you are not left empty-handed. A beautifully crafted katana,
covered in stone dust, is all that remains of the Heart of Stone.

You unwield Heart of Stone.
As you take Yearning Star in hand an undefinable presence
seems to collect around you. The blade sparkles brightly
and for just an instant you faintly see Shenanigans spelled
out in its stars.

As you use the sword the WC goes up.  Not sure if each tier represents a jump
or just achieving a level of WC.
