Staff from Vago's stronhold.

To get it go to vago's, to the northern most room and 'press stone'.
Go back to entrace, go north, kill golem
Go north again and get pillar, leave south immediately!
  -   you have a chance to automatically move south, but seems like a dex
      check that could fail and result in death

Starts at a higher WC and goes down over time until it breaks.

- Heart of Stone (solid)
- Heart of Stone (slightly cracked)
- Heart of Stone (badly cracked)
- Heart of Stone (falling apart)
- Heart of Stone (crumbling)

Breaking:

With a short, sharp snap the staff breaks into unusable fragments.
As the last bits of stone crumble into dust in your hands, you find
that you are not left empty-handed. A beautifully crafted katana,
covered in stone dust, is all that remains of the Heart of Stone.

You unwield Heart of Stone.
As you take Yearning Star in hand an undefinable presence
seems to collect around you. The blade sparkles brightly
and for just an instant you faintly see Shenanigans spelled
out in its stars.

Notes:

As you use the sword the WC goes up.  Not sure if each tier represents a jump
or just achieving a level of WC.

Yearning Star progress over time in WC and eventually gets a penetration special.

- Yearning Star (dusty)
- Yearning Star (dim)
- Yearning Star (twinkling)
- Yearning Star (shining)
- Yearning Star (sparkling)
  - gains ~4% penetration
- Yearning Star (brilliant)
  - gains ~8% penetration
  - takes hours to get here
  - WC might be maxed here, genscan can't go higher than 990
