Veneratus Nex

This equipment is found on zombie lords in the temple of the zombie god.  To
enter the temple go to wyk in wayhaven, buy the stone, come to temple, place
in hand of statue, and say patesco.

Warning:

I believe you have to find and equip this eq at least once every 7 normal
days.  If you don't your progress is reset.
