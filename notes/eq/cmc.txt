Need to kill firebat to wear/use the cmc.
- The days old the firebat is when you kill it dictates which suits you can
  wear
  - 'tagcheck' to see which you can wear

Days:

0:Standard Issue
1:Reinforced
2:Advanced
3:Specialized
4:Absurd
5:God-Like
6:Metaphysically Unstable
7:Physically Impossible

What it does:

- heals
- can reflect an attack
- can block an attack
- as a main, provides AC
- dmg reduction
- stat boost
- can cause dmg
- statu boosts

When transmuted, loses all AC
When a main, tons of AC
String 2.0 can string it and KEEP AC
