"The Mordenheim dining experience"

As the dial is turned, a searing jolt of electricity passes through your
body, turning you into a cinder which shortly burns itself out.  Have a
nice afterlife.

[[ Warning: You are not currently in the midst of battle. ]]
[[ You can not experience a surge of adrenaline while at rest.]]

The carapace retracts from you, flowing into a small blob.


You see the Grim Reaper appear before you.

You see a flock of buzzards fly over and descend upon the tattered
corpse of Shenanigans, courtesy of The Mordenheim dining experience.
The buzzards feed like piranhas and leave a shattered skeleton in their
wake...

You die.
You have a strange feeling.
You can see your own dead body from above.
