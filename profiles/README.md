# Profiles
Profiles start the tintin session.  To use this framework you need a profile that:
- matches your character name and ends in '.tin'
- has a '#var guild {<your guild here>};' defined line in the file

See 'profile_example.tin' for an example.  You can copy this file and rename it to your character name.
