# Profiles

Profiles are used to start the tintin session.  To use this framework you need a profile that:
-   matches your character name and ends in '.tin'
-   has a '#var guild {<your guild here>};' defined line in the file

See 'profiles/profile_example.tin' for an example.

You can copy this example file and rename it to your character name, or use the `bin/create_profile` utility.

## Usage

`bin/create_profile [your character] [your guild]
