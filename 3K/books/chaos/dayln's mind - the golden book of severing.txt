As you open this golden book, you feel a wave of power.

 Hello Brave Traveller
      If you are reading this then you must have defeated me 
    and although that saddens me it also takes a great burden 
    off of my soul. My descent into madness was not total, I 
    occasionally had lucid moments, and it was in one of these 
    moments that I forged this tome. For your bravery in 
    conquering me and putting an end to my insane plan to take 
    over the mud, I bequeath this book to you. Contained within 
    the gold of this book is the power to sever you from this 
    realm when you are in need. If such an emergency arises, you 
    need only open this book and type 'rescueme'.

      Once again I thank you, and wish you well in your 
    continuing travels.

                   D
You turn the page to page 2.

   PS. Beware the power of this book, for it is truly great. And 
    although it may save you from death the cost may still be high.
You are at the end of the book.
