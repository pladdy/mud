*-*-*-*-*-*- Introduction -*-*-*-*-*-*

Greetings fellow fisherman!

Your journey towards mastering the sea has just begun and
it will be a long and perhaps in some cases perilous journey.
There are a wide range of things that an advancing fisherman
needs to be aware of and I've compiled a list of useful titbits
into the journal you hold before you.

I hope it will guide you to experience and appreciate
the richness of fishing!

*-*-*-*-*-*- Rods -*-*-*-*-*-*

In order to be successful in fishing you need of course a good
and reliable fishing pole. These come in a wide selection of
quality and price and certain kinds may be more useful than
others.

There are two specific factors that come into play with rods.

Strength   - This is how durable the actual rod is. During usage
             a rod will crack and splinter and most likely
             eventually break. However, the more strength a
             rod has the longer it will last.

Mitigation - This determines how well the rod handles in your
             hand. The higher mitigation a rod has the less
             endurance you will need in order to use it.

Rods can be bought but they can also be found in odd places
around the realm. If you were proficient enough you could
perhaps make your own.

*-*-*-*-*-*- Line -*-*-*-*-*-*

Naturally, you need a good strong line to fish. Basic lines
can usually be found in shops specialized in fishing equipment.
It will do for the novices, but in order to truly master the
water you will need stronger things.

 The lines have a quality property which determines how long
and more importantly how much strain the line can take before
breaking. Also some lines are sold in bulk with several usages.

*-*-*-*-*-*- Bait -*-*-*-*-*-*

To successfully hook a fish you may or may not need to use
bait. It depends on how desperate the fish is. Bait is sold
in your typical fishing store. There are, however, other
things that can be used as bait.

Different bait has different attractiveness. The higher the
attractiveness the higher chance you have to actually hook a fish.

*-*-*-*-*-*- Fishing -*-*-*-*-*-*

To actually perform a successful fishing session there are
several things you should be aware of. I've assembled a
series of techniques that I find useful when I 'fish'.

Reel  - To drag the fish closer to your position you can
        'reel' the fish. This will cause strain to increase
        on your line and will most likely drain part of your
        endurance but it's a necessary thing to eventually be
        able to 'catch' it.

Pull  - This will 'pull' the fish either to the left or right
        of your position. It's important to understand that
        when fishing you deal with distance both lengthwise
        as well as sideways.

Slack - To ease up on the building tension you can choose to
        'slack' the line. This will of course give the fish
	 some breathing room as well but more importantly it
	 will diminish some of the built up strain on your line.

As a final note, should the fish be winning and you realize
that you will never catch it you can simply 'cease' and start over.

*-*-*-*-*-*- Weather -*-*-*-*-*-*

One of the more important factors when fishing is the weather.
Naturally the harder weather there is, the harder time you'll
have to actually catch a fish. Harsh weather will for example
introduce a wide range of events that you would never see in
calmer regions of the sea. It could be excessive strain on your
line, unforeseeable currents and shifts in the waves and other
things.

It's not all bad though. Certain weather can add to your luck
with fishing and there are quite a few tales out there of a
lucky wave bringing the catch close to the boat.

*-*-*-*-*-*- Treasure -*-*-*-*-*-*

The best thing with fishing is that you never know what you
might get. Granted, the most common thing to catch is fish and
fish-like animals. However there are lots of things to find!
Strange boxes, items of various qualities and other nick knacks!

*-*-*-*-*-*- Tips -*-*-*-*-*-*

So you've got a fish hooked and now you need to 'catch' it?

Well, there are a few things one has to consider.
1 - Do you have enough endurance to do the final 'catch'?
2 - Will the strain of the line hold or will it break?

An experienced fisherman can feel the strain and can deduce if
the line will hold. This together with knowing his (or hers) own
body fatigue will result in the total chance of success.

These are the two main factors when it comes to actually manage to
catch your fish. There are other smaller factors that also come
into play but they are too many for me to list here.
