 # stat boost

You say: invocation
Laveau says: To begin the ritual you must give me a reagent, a symbol of
            the loa that you wish to summon.  I trust you have The Book of
            Voodoo Ritual in your possession so that you know what role
            you must play in the Invocation.                              

You say: loa                                                                  
Laveau says: Loa are the immortal spirits of the ancestors or archetypal
            representations of the natural world and of moral principles,
            such as love, death, war and the ocean.  Which loa in
            particular interests you?  Dambala, Ayezan, Ogoun, Erzulie,
            Aida, Yemaya, Papa Ghede, Lady Luck, Eshu Elegua?             

You say: dambala                                                              
Laveau says: The symbolic father of the loa, Dambala represents the
            ancestral knowledge that forms the foundation of our belief. 
            His symbol is the snake.                                      

You say: ayezan                                                               
Laveau says: Ayezan is one of the many loa who represents healing.  She is
            a protector and guardian of religious ceremonies and her
            symbol is the leaf.      
# leaf is upstairs in the dirt at the entrance
# give leaf to laveau, trace shield, drink goblet +5 con 
# also a mission for henkey

You say: ogoun                                                                
Laveau says: Ogoun is a powerful warrior loa who represents all aspects of
            power, strength, and masculinity, including war, fire,
            lightning and politics.  His symbol is anything involving war.

You say: erzulie                                                              
Laveau says: Representing love, purity, the ideal female and the moon,
            Erzulie is the most beloved of the loa.  Her symbol is the
            heart.       
# red microchip on first floor se corner? heart of a computer...

You say: aida                                                                 
Laveau says: Aida is the wife of Dambala and represents beauty, fertility
            and new life.  Her symbol is the rainbow.                     
# rada has prism, say prism (near boxing rink)

You say: yemaya                                                               
Laveau says: Known as the Mother of the Ocean, Yemaya is often depicted as
            a mermaid or siren.  Her symbol is water.                     
# glass of water is in the lounge on the table

You say: papa ghede                                                           
Laveau says: Ghede is the eternal figure in black, controlling the eternal
            crossroads at which everyone must someday cross over.  Known
            as the spirit of death, other spirits fear him and try to
            avoid him.  Ghede's symbol is a cross upon a tomb.            

You say: lady luck                                                            
Laveau says: Lady Luck controls every action we make, you don't want to
            get on her bad side.  Her symbol is dice.                     

You say: eshu elgua                                                           
Laveau says: Eshu Elegua is the trickster loa.  Full of mischief and
            humour, he is a spirit we can rely on to brighten our day.  He
            also is one of the few loa who can communicate with the
            Creator God.  His symbol is rum.
