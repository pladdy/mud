search records in library, read diary:
  You stare at the notes you've made to remind yourself of what
  you think the words mean - and cross your fingers that you got
  it right...
  
  In the days of the great emperor <hmmm...>, our village
  prospered under the benign guidance of <hmmm...>. Only
  16 heads got cut off this month so the lord was pretty
  calm about things.
  
  Then the wizard <hmm...> came to serve our lord.  However,
  he angered the lord and was sentenced to be put to death.
  But the wizard, unknown to any of us, was in league with
  the dark gods.  Those gods we dare not name...
  
  (hmm, big blood spot, the gods were active back then...)
  
  The wizard tricked our lord into having one of us try
  on a suit of armour to prove the armour would be of
  use to our lord and not harmful.
  
  The evil gods entered the suit and it destroyed the
  dwelling of the man chosen.  Then the armour hid
  in amongst the dark places and destroys everyone
  who dares to approach it.
  
  Please, save us from the evil gods and restore our
  honour and family...

trace symbol on cop in police station:
  The cop says in a hollow echoing voice:
  The wise ones have forseen that the person who defeats
  the raging demons will carry the dark powers within
  while using the power of light to free our land.
  Suddenly the cop stares at you and starts to scream!
  Don't attack without... and he is suddenly struck dumb!
