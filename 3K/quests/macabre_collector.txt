For Aunt May in cottage:

Items:
i'm guessing depending on reboot one of the items below (book, net, or jar) is
used to catch fairies

jar is in dresser in west kitchen
watch is in chairs in library
dust is upstairs in chest
pressed flower book, pots in room near shed
  book lets you catch fairies 'catch fairy'
net, search boxes in shed

Steps:
4 fairies are out in the open which means 2 are hidden...no idea where they are
  need to try the maze again, perhaps there's a pattern?
  
can i get the other fairies from the fairy area in fantasy (faerie glade)?  

tried faerie glade and it didn't work
