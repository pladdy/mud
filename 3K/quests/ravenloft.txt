when you get to castle, and enter, if you go east look at room:
if room has 4 dragon statues you cannot go back west (should be one way on map).
if you try you can get blicked.

mapping is a challenge as the towers span multiple floors and it seems some
exits may drop multiple floors.  trying not to overlap rooms incorrectly so
map each level completely before going further.
