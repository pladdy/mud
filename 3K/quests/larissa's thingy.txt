Larissa's Thingy, 25 qps

Go to house and 'get letter' from mailbox

read letter:

  Larissa,
  
  I've taken and destroyed your thingy.  It's gone forever and you shall
  never see it again.  Blown into a million pieces it is.  Little chunks
  of wood have been scattered all over the realm in a religious ceremony
  for your thingy.  Pity you weren't there to see it.  It really was quite
  touching.
  
  Why do you ask?  Because my truly warped and twisted mind could no
  longer bear the fact that there are thingies in the world.  They must be
  destroyed.  Forever destroyed.  How could you possibly bring such a
  horrendous creation into being?  I'll never understand.  But it makes no
  difference now.  It's over.  Gone forever.
  
  Yours truly,
  
  Max.
  
  P.S.  Hope things are well.  Hugs to the family from me.
