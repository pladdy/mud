after killing minotaur in maze and ghost

As the Ghost fades to nothingness the image of the Good King
grows and solidifies.  He smiles sadly at you.  `Thank you
kind adventurer.  But you have come too late to save my mortal
body.  But my soul is now mine own once again.  Look to your
feet and you shall see two powerful items which will break
the curse of my friend Zetron and free Kimlark's people to
live again.  Find my throne, sit yourself upon it, then you
will find a chest.  Place the crystal inside.  And once
again...thank you.  Now I must follow my soul and atone for
my foolishness.  Goodbye!'  The image disappears.

leave maze (climb cleft)

get back to throne

sit sthrone

place crystal in chest

voila
