Nuke, 25 qps

Go to 'Oasis in the badlands' area in science.

find wass in computer room, take hostage, interrogate wass:
  Now that you have taken Wass hostage, you waste
  no time getting the details of the launch from him. He
  tells you that he left the keycard in the glovebox of the
  jeep on the south side of the test site. You
  must <search glovebox> to find it.
  He also gives up the launch code, "12.27.74".

peruse papers in room with private tylor after he's dead:

  You sit down to peruse the papers and soon discover some startling things.
  
  Quickly scanning the documents, you realize that
  this place is a nuclear missile silo from the
  old U.S. military. The reason this is relevant,
  you soon find out, is that the lost city of
  Washington D.C. is still there. The radiation of
  the fields surrounding it has kept people from
  learning of its existence.
  
  The bandits who live here now used to be U.S.
  military soldiers who have a serious dislike
  for anything from D.C., although you aren't sure
  why. It seems they are setting up this place to
  nuke D.C. again, although first they must test
  fire the one here so that when they locate
  another missile silo they will know what to do
  about D.C. itself. Somewhere in here must be the
  location of the test site.
  
  You read the documents carefully, and discover that the test site
  is just north of Detroit.
  
  As you are putting away the last
  of the documents, several bandits come
  around the corner surprising you!
  Bandit fires his rifle at you.
