Hurinteon (in raric, sw corner, key in tower):

You say: job
Hurinteon says: I am a master mage. I know many, many spells. I've
                studied magic all my life.

Hurinteon chants and casts a few simple spells.

You say: spells
Hurinteon says: Yes, all kinds of magic. Although I still can't use
                magic to heal. I guess healing is just for the gods.

Hurinteon sighs deeply.

You say: heal
Hurinteon says: What I don't quite understand is what kind of magic
                powers these gods have that is able to bind wounds so
                well and to give life.

Hurinteon ponders the mysteries of the Universe.


Hurinteon says: Oh well, maybe I'll never know in this life time.

You say: desaren
Hurinteon says: Desaren was my teacher.  I believe that he was the most
                powerful mage to walk the face of Serinth.  He had
                almost everything except control.

You say: control

Hurinteon lets out a deep sigh.

Hurinteon says: I admired Desaren very much. He was powerful and
                righteous.  The greed for power and magic turned into
                greed for life.  He also wanted to live forever.  So sad
                is the price for immortality.

You say: immortality

Hurinteon looks deep into your eyes.

Hurinteon says: Everyone wants to live forever.  Even if it means to
                die.  He was good and pure, but then he turned evil and
                greedy.  It is rare to find someone who is powerful but
                righteous.

You say: righteous

Hurinteon says: Very rare. I've known only a few who had so much to live
                for, yet gave it all up for others.

Hurinteon shakes his head in grief.

Hurinteon says: Keylon and Saleyic sacrificed themselves to save many
                lives and to save the soul of their dear friend,
                Desaren.

You say: keylon

Hurinteon says: Keylon and Saleyic died while fighting Desaren.  Saleyic
                must have called upon the gods to destroy Desaren.
                Everything in a mile radius was destroyed.

Hurinteon takes a moment to think.

Hurinteon says:  The powers clashing between Desaren and Saleyic were so
                great that they turned all magic into chaos.  No one was
                able to cast a spell correctly.  Two new moons were
                created. One of good and one of evil.  The split magic
                of Desaren.  It is said that Saleyic had become a god.
                Keylon, his spirit still roams around this realm.

Hurinteon says: Well Desaren once told me that I possess strange and
                powerful magic.  He said I was destined to help someone
                do a very special quest.  He told me to create a special
                scroll with two languages.  I call it the scroll of
                knowledge.

Hurinteon shrugs helplessly.

** i'm guessing i need this to understand mobs, but don't know how to get it **
## talk to salinsha first about hurinteon, then he tells you

'knowledge
You say: knowledge
>
Hurinteon tells you: It contains lizardman and ogre language.  It can be
                     found in the room that is guarded by the Aerial
                     servant.  Just speak the word 'knowledge' there and
                     you will get one.

You say: serinth
> Hurinteon peers at you quizzically.

Hurinteon says: Serinth is the world we live in.  It is only a speck of
                this material plane we exist on.

You say: plane
>
Hurinteon says: There are several planes that exist.  We live on the
                prime material plane.  Others are negative, positive,
                elemental, astral, and ethereal.

'negative or positive
You say: negative
>
Hurinteon says: For example, undead creatures get their power from the
                negative material plane.  The energy from negative plane
                is associated with evil.  Where positive plane is of
                good.  The light to drive away evil or undead.

'elemental
You say: elemental
>
Hurinteon says: There are four elemental planes. Air, earth, fire, and
                water.  Creatures from those planes usually stay in
                their own domain, but sometimes they come to the prime
                material plane for some special reason or are summoned
                here by a mage or cleric.

'astral or eterheal
You say: astral
>
Hurinteon says: The astral plane is the pathway to the realm of the
                gods.  Pathway to Heaven and Hell.  Ethereal plane is
                the buffer to all the other planes that exist.  Many
                creatures dwell in both these planes.

You say: salinsha
>
Hurinteon says: Salinsha is my sister. She lives somewhere in the city
                of Keyloncia. I haven't seen her much lately.

You say: birth
>
Hurinteon's cheeks turn rosy pink.


Hurinteon says: I was born with a birth mark in the symbol of the god of
                magic. Desaren said I was chosen. He did not say what I
                was chosen for.
