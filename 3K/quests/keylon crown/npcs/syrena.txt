You say: desaren
Syrena says: He was a very powerful mage. I never did get to know him
             well.  He was always wrapped up in his work.

You say: work
Syrena says: Always working on a new spell or something.  The last thing
             I remember him working on was a mirror.

You say: mirror
Syrena says: I don't know what it was.  I just know it was very
             powerful.

Syrena shrugs helplessly.

Syrena says: Oh, I think it was called the mirror of fate.

You say: keylon
Syrena looks at you with very sad eyes.

Syrena says: Keylon was my father.  He died battling evil.  The sad
             thing is, the evil being was his best and dearest friend.

Syrena burst out crying.

You say: evil
Syrena says: The man was Desaren.  At one time he was good, but the dark
             side took over.

You say: satarus
Syrena says: Satarus is the lizardmen king. He might still have the
             dust.  That is all I know about it.

'dust
You say: dust
Syrena says: Satarus is the lizardmen king. He might still have the
             dust.  That is all I know about it

You say: hurinteon
>
Syrena says: Hurinteon is Salinsha's brother.  I do not know much about
             him.

'salinsha
You say: salinsha
> Syrena smiles at you.


Syrena says: She is my best and closest friend.  She is a Paladin and
             helps me to be fair and honorable.


You say: paladin
>
Syrena says: Someday, I hope to be righteous and honorable to become a
             Paladin.

> 'honorable
You say: honorable
>
Syrena says: Salinsha is both honorable and fair, and she always speaks
             the truth.


You say: truth
>
Syrena says: Very few people speak the whole truth and nothing but the
             truth.  I once heard that Satarus had some magical dust
             that forced people to tell the truth.

You say: ill
>
Syrena says: Well, when I was much younger, I was ill.  A brave
             adventurer went on a quest to find the cure.  Finally that
             person found the cure and saved my life.

Syrena blushes.

You say: cure
>
Syrena says: I drank from a blessed cup of Lucanus.

You say: lucanus
>
Syrena says: I do not know much about the Lucanus stuff.  I heard they
             were a bunch of special adventurers who were given magical
             items by the gods.
