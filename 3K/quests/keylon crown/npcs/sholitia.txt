Sholitia says: Well, actually I don't like being called a thief.  I do
               not steal from people.

You say: steal
Sholitia says: I don't steal or backstab others.  I just use certain
               skills that thieves know to get things done.

You say: skills
Sholitia says: Well, things like moving silently and picking certain
               locks that need to be picked.

# try saying locks, or picked?

Sholitia grins.

You say: mage
Sholitia says: I have learned that one needs magic to get certain
               imaginable things done.

Sholitia smiles.
