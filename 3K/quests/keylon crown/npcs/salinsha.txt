Salinsha says: Hello.

Salinsha gives you a warm smile.


Salinsha says: A pleasure to meet you, Shenanigans.

You say: syrena
> Salinsha smiles happily.


Salinsha says: Syrena is Keylon's daughter and my best friend.

You say: keylon
>
Salinsha says: My lord Keylon raised me as if I was his own daughter.
               He treated Syrena and me as an equal.  I owe everything
               to him.  His glory shall live on forever.

You say: glory
> Salinsha has a sad look upon her face.


Salinsha says: Keylon died honorably.  To save the lives of many, he
               sacrificed himself.  You may want to ask my brother more
               about this.

You say: brother
>
Salinsha says: Hurinteon is my brother.  We were separated at birth and
               reunited when he was about 18.  He is now a powerful
               mage.

You say: birth
>
Salinsha says: You are gonna have to ask him about that one.

You say: mage
>
Salinsha says: He is unlike any other mage.  His powers were as if they
               were given to him by the gods.  As if he was destined to
               be a mage.

Salinsha shrugs helplessly.

You say: gods
>
Salinsha says: Yes, he was born with a strange birth mark.  Almost like
               the symbol of the god of magic.  I believe that I too was
               destined to be a paladin.

You say: paladin
>
Salinsha stands proudly.


Salinsha says: I uphold law and order to maintain good.  Only a few are
               worthy to be a paladin.  I shall remain honorable till
               death!

You say: worthy
>
Salinsha says: Death before dishonor.  Keylon has taught me what it
               means to be honorable.

You say: friend
>
Salinsha says: I've known Syrena since childhood.  She was like my
               sister.  A while ago she was very, very ill.

You say: ill
>
Salinsha says: Syrena had some strange kind of illness.  No one really
               knew of the cure.  But one day, a brave adventurer took
               upon the quest to find the cure.  Luckily that person
               found the cure and saved the little princess, Syrena.
