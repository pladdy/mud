Panthorin says: I wish others traveled as much as me.

Panthorin says: Then maybe you can be of some help.

You say: help
Panthorin says: I have been searching for an Ogre named Koricu.  I was
                wondering if you by any chance have seen or met him.
                Have you?

Panthorin eagerly awaits your answer.

You say: no
Panthorin sighs deeply.

You say: yes
Panthorin says: Take me to him.  I will follow you.  Just say stop if
                you want me to stop following and say follow if you want
                me to start following again.
