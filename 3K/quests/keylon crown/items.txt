  - Oft I must strive with wind and wave,
    Battle them both when under the sea.
    I feel out the bottom, a foreign land.
    In lying still I am strong in the strife;
    If I fail in that they are stronger than I
    And wrenching me loose, soon put me to rout.
    They wish to capture what I must keep.
    I can master them both if my grip holds out,
    If the rocks bring succor and lend me support,
    Strength in the struggle. What am I?

    answer anchor
