You look at the paper briefly but the writing on it is impossible to
read. As you are about to throw it away you notice a small map has been
scribbled down on the back side of it.
                              \ /
                               *-*
                              \   \
                                -  *
                              /     \
                               *-O * *
                              /       \
                             *   *  -*-*
                              \ /  |/
                               * *-*

You realize that the map is not complete and that time has made
details vanish.
