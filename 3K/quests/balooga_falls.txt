Cerebella says: They are ruthless, deadly and fast. They have
                killed many of my loved ones.  Our fighters couldn't
                kill any of them, not alone, nor in teams of four.
                They are not meant to be killed by mortal hands, our
                only hope I'm afraid, is some gift from the heavens.
                But Gnos does not give on a silver platter. It is 
                always: seek and ye shall find.

Cerebella says: Gnos is the true god. He does not judge. He does not rule
                by fear, guilt or subjugation. In other words, he lacks
                the human frailties that the False God abuses and in the
                end, becomes. A Gnostic need not force his beliefs upon
                others because Gnos exists even without faith. Faith is
                the ultimate salvation, for Gnos is very much here, and
                infusing us with his power, unconditionally, every day.
