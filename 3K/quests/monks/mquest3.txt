   Since you want to get stronger in the guild, you should first get
   stronger in the body.  Tell me where in Science you can 'lift weights'
   for a strength boost.

checked voodoo scavengers, found a hole in the wall first floor (marked on map)
across from elevator room, check that out.
       
Notes:
contention training grounds had weights, couldn't lift weights
drexler's nano labs had weights in dr wong's room, couldn't lift

Trent tells you: It's neither of those.  You're on the right track in
        thinking of an organized group.   Try looking in the major cities
        in Science - it's an area in one of those.
  
20:28 Trent : No fighting involved to get to the weight lifting

20:29 Trent : the area in general, well, you won't want to be hitting
              akill on everyone
        
Comb through atlanta, detroit, new york
organized groups is silicon wraiths in detroit, only area not aggro

pittsburgh is all aggro
atlanta has no gangs in it that aren't aggro/easy to kill
new york doesn't have an organized group that can hurt you

ANSWER:

NW rec room in silicon wraiths has a bench you can 'load x', 'lie on bench',
'lift weights', and 'stand'
