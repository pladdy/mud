   Your mquest this time will be solely in the realm of Fantasy.  I want
   you to slay Skanateth and bring me his ring.  To finish off this
   mquest slay for me the monster "Ixitxachitl".  While the monsters
   themselves shouldn't prove to be too hard of a fight, finding them
   will be.  Good luck, young Monk!
   
skanateth made me think of serinth but no idea why

lookup ixitxachitl in wayhaven library
After an exhaustive search you finally find something relevant.
Ixitxachitl: An intelligent, aquatic being that resembles a small manta
ray with a barbed tail.  The ixitxachitl is an evil carnivore that has
no natural predators.  They adopt a variety of social orders, and some
forms may be vampiric (rare).

on whether or not i can use rating to avoid dying :P
10:07 Rictor : I'd not rely on that, no.
10:08 Rictor : Especially in the Ixitxachitl one, the area is quite big
               and a lot of sub areas, nto sure if rating would take the
               sub areas into account or not.
               
14:12 To: Rictor : I've been working on your mquest.  Haven't found anything
                   yet but I've managed to start Cernunnos, Seahaven, and
                   Keylon crown.  I was looking for "water" like places for
                   the "ixit." manta ray monster.  Searched Murus Faralain as
                   well but still plugging along.  Managed to die finally as
                   well today heh.  Found a lake like place under Murus Fara.
                   but nothing there that I could find initially.
14:47 Rictor : Hmm, maybe you should go back to the lake like area..

in lake area in murus faralain i'm trying to kill all fish in lake...seeing if
that will summon this thing

it's probably in the pool in fauntist guild:

17:04 Rictor : Btw, something outside the pool in the naturalist guild
               might help with your movement inside the pool.
               # answer to this is the tiles...climb tiles to get out in
               # certain rooms
               # no, i think he means some object will help me swim and such
               # NO, it means opening the gate in the pool is outside of the 
               # pool.

11:25 To: Rictor : i'm hopelessly stuck on your mquest.  i'm pretty convinced
                   i'm looking for a ladder but i have no clue how i'm
                   missing it
11:25 To: Rictor : sorry, that was rude.  hi and how are you first :)?
11:28 Rictor : No ladder, you were very close previously.
11:28 Rictor : Focus your search among the water areas
11:29 Rictor : You have found out how to get out of the area and all that
               right?
11:29 To: Rictor : i bring my own rope heh
11:29 Rictor : Ah nod, didn't know that worked, there is a rope in the
               area
11:29 To: Rictor : but my rope won't let me get up the wall in the arena, i
                   need something like al adder, or a grappling hook, or
                   something
11:30 Rictor : But unrelated to your mquest
11:30 Rictor : Nah... you found out how to open doors and such?
11:32 To: Rictor : only found a set of keys that let me into the arena doors,
                   nothing else
11:36 Rictor : But either way, lots of things in that area to discover,
               but focus your search on the water area, other side of the
               arena.
11:37 Rictor : other side of the area that is.

14:04 Rictor : Pretty sure its well hidden, or at least hidden.
14:10 To: Rictor : i'll start at the pool edge, and then back into the pool. 
                   maybe there's a tile that or some such thing that can be
                   manipulated.  logic suggests it'd be outisde the pool
                   because the naturalists wouldn't want to be in the pool
                   with dangerous creatures.  but logic has failed me on
                   quests
   --Rictor agreed
14:14 Rictor : Focus outside the pool, and if you find anything that
               might suggest something... go re-check the pool and its
               dead ends.
               
# try the button in the center of the area again
# nope, se room, to the last pool, there are wheels on the wall.  turn the left
# wheel, and the right wheel,  opens the doors.  ixit is then swimming in the 
# pool and is aggro

# i can kick/break/pick doors in the area, but none near the water area show
# me what i need.

# verbs for doors: kick/break/pick/smash/force/pound/crash
NOT 
  boot,
  blast,
  charge,

  knock,
  headbutt,
  jimmy,
  pry,
  pull,
  punch,
  push,
  ram,
  rip,   
  shake
  shoulder, 
  strike
   
still missing at least one verb

# doors seem random per boots/reset to what you can do

# there are two pools in the area, one small one and in the se room you can 
# dive into a pipe with a porticullis to the se, can't open it yet
