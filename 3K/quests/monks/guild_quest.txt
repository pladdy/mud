Ice Cube	search corridor, put in bag…
Ice Wedge	search crack in e,w room
Icicle	jump to get icicle, center room (repeat)
Snow Flake	search snow, west room
Warm Stone	search water, north room

cube cools hands as you hold it, melted at 17 emotes
wedge cools hands you hold, melted at 15 emotes
icicle melts after a while, no emotes
snow flake cools hands, melts in 2 emotes


Room of ice, light below…?

Don't need to buy boots or gloves to solve

resets at boots, quit out to restart quest

seems like it progresses from bigger ice to smaller ice (significant?)

don't drop stone, it dests

iciicles seem infinite

Attempts:
---------
i tried holding them in order, snowflake, icicle, wedge, cube, but i just
see your hands getting colder emotes.  nothing after that

tried smashing, melting, breaking ice floor with stone...nothing so far

i have no idea what you do in the glass room.

Hints from Admin:
-----------------
10:20 Thane : Couple of pointers...bagging the items is required to keep
              them from melting
10:21 Thane : Everything you need is in the basement - no need to search
              anywhere but those few rooms
