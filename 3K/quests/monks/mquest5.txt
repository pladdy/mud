   You next quest will be your most challenging yet and will spread
   across all the realms.  From Fantasy find and restore the Shadow
   Sword.  From Chaos find ANY piece of "Musical Equipment". From Science
   find a small, bomb looking ball. Let's not leave the Pinnacle out of
   the fun! Find someone that will give you a "Ninja Badge". Good luck
   and Have fun!
