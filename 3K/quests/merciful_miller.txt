arrested, free, bars,

You say: bars

Nyess says: Jonin says a file or chisel would work, but I would have to
           conceal it somehow to sneak it past the guards.

Nyess says: If you could figure out a way to hide a tool in some food and
           give it to me, I can smuggle it into Jonin's cell.

Nyess says: No one in the city will help me in fear of what Crett might
           do, but I've heard of a miller to the north that will do
           anything if the price is right.

Nyess says: Please hurry, Crett won't wait forever...

not sure who the miller is

on arealist there is a windmill area that i haven't found yet, millers use
windmills to make flour perhaps.  where is the windmill though?

more north, look (tracks)
