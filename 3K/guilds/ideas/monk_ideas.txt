Method ideas:
Dragon gives +1 wis per point in method.  Ups your hit dmg as well as palm.  
Given the stance you're in I would think this is an appropriate boost for palm
and makes Dragon a lot more fun.

Discipleship to expand so disciples can be based on glvl.  Glvl / 20 disciples
perhaps?  Gxp bonus should be small, but automatic.  As long as master is logged
in disciples get small bonus.  In party the master gets a bonus.  Encourages
big monks to take smaller monks out more?
