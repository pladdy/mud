Clone to me is amazingly thematic and unique to our guild.  And no one uses it
because you burn 4 slots and it's not that great.  I think by default we should
all have access to Clone and get a mindless follower.  Again it's thematic and
would just be plain cool.

To make the other phases more useful, and to potentially help us scale more, 
rather than clone just hitting as hard as a synthorg attack I think it should
mirror the gentech's attack based on their bias setting, experiments in offense,
and phases as well.  I think to compensate for this the clones attack per round
would also be the same as the gentechs output that round (which when maxed would
be 29 I believe).

I'm not sure how well it tanks or heals, but I don't think it should end up a
super tank as that's the gentech's job.  Perhaps the other experiments, healing
and armor, can be converted to Combat II and Combat III?  This would be like
giving the Clone Synthorg, DDB, and Ionbeam attack options.  Just a thought.
