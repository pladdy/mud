Autorepair tech/gen should be upgraded to regen .1% reps per round.  This would
make it a little more like a monk or mage regen and not the painfully useless
and slow regen it provides today.

Engineering Gen/Tech should be changed so when used they can actually overheal
a gentechs reps to 1% over 100 per phase.  The benefit to this would be to 
directly boost the damage and defensive output of all powers.  I think it would
be best applied such that the 10% on offense raises the damage cap.  The 10% on
defense would be a flat decrease on incoming dmg.  This would help us handle
specials and scale more effectively.

Stabilize would then be much more useful as it could ensure boosts stay at peak
levels and bigger gens have insentives to use so many slots for reps (which is
sadly necessary today).
