====GENTECH====      time displace (experiment)     ====GENTECH====
Time Displace:

Very similar to the Timeshift experiment, Time Displace gives the
genetic soldier the ability to phase their physical incarnation in and out
of existence relative to immediate threats on the battlefield.  Using complex
movement algorithms stored and run in real time from the soldiers arm casing,
predictions are made governing incoming bombardment and how to avoid them.

THe phasing in and out of the space/time continuim coupled with the movement
analysis of the gentechs enemies means incoming damage can be reduced or
completely avoided.

====GENTECH====    tdisplace (command)    ====GENTECH====
Syntax  : tdisplace
Cost    : 30 PU/glevel
          3 PU/hit
Research: Scientific Metrics, Time Displace

the tdisplace command creates a displacement field around the gentech soldier.
It also starts the algorithms needed to create movement pattern and predictions.
As each movement can be varied and slightly different, a power cost is incured
for each hit avoided to any degree in order to keep the arm casing functioning
at optimal speeds for successful defensive combat.
