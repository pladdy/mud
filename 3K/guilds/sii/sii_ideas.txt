I totally stole this from Etah.  This would be a great utility to have
I think.

Name:         Psionic Pulse
Syntax:       pulse [magnify] [on|off]
Restrictions: Control level 2, 8
Costs:        default: 15 spell points, little control
              magnify: 30 spell points, little control
Notes:        [default]
              Darkness can easily be overcome by puling our neurons and
              monitoring the environment.  By activating a pulse, a sii can
              be more aware of whats around them regardless of how much
              light is available.

              [magnify]
              Rather than just increasing awareness with the pulse, the sii
              attempts to amplify the pulses to gather more information.
              this increases the awareness of what might have been harder
              to see.
              
* gives +1 light or +2 if magnify is used
* boost adds +1 light 

Brood are fragile, but it'd be cool to be able to protect them on a short
term level so we can avoid losing them to forced hits, etc.

Name:         Psionic Blanket
Syntax:       blanket [on|off|check]
Restrictions: Control level 5
Costs:        Some control
Notes:        With continued practice routing damage away from our hosts
              and into our neurons, we can learn to protect the broods we
              produce in the same way.  By layering psionic energy around
              our brood we can divert incoming damage from their frail
              forms to our neurons.  As with any form of damage overloading
              the Sii must be careful not to overextend themselves or face
              dire consequences.
              
* diverts damage from brood to overload pool.  since brood have horrible
  tanking ability this is really to just keep them alive in those rare
  occurences where a flipped bird, forced hit, etc. might blick them all

-- plan to simplify brood --
i'm not sure, but the fact that brood do some dmg might be what's causing so 
many issues in keeping them alive.  they're small, aren't bs, and so can't tank
crazy hits.  if for followers to hit they have to become targets, perhaps how
brood contribute can change.  broodlings are a lot of fun, themeatic and it'd
be great to see them as more useful without being overly bs.  again, it's just
cool having them around.

# act as a object that follows and that cannot be attacked (like orb in fauntist
  guild)

# brood don't do damage or tank: they help the sii do more damage by scurring 
  about like crazy things creating chaos in combat for the mob.  i think this
  can translate simply as a boost to the sii's dmg.
  
  one idea is each brood contributes 1 point to the critical hit mskill, or to
  the penetrate mskill for the sii.  this way it implements the skill system
  and is themeatic.  the penetrate boost would probably be most thematic because
  it represents the sii clamering at the mob trying to pierce it's defenses
  and the sii taking advantage of that.

# won't dest/disappear after linkdeath

# kamikaze will still function but actually do some decent dmg.  considering 
  it's a one shot hit and brood are pain to build up with lots of corpses, it
  would be nice if it were more worthwhile.  would 50 points of dmg per
  broodling be too bs?
  
-- brood modifications
ways to boost broods in guild, can be associated with a coin cost.  
also the limit on what can be done to your brood is set by glvl.  
maybe 1 attribute per 5 glvls: 5, 10, 15, 20

Modifications are performed by formsmiths who using other biological means
can augment a sii's brood to accomplish more tasks on the battlefield.

  Tzentach Slime: 
    brood give +1 light (minimum of 10 broodlings)

  Adrenal Augmentation: 
    brood increase sii's defense score by hounding the mob and making it hard
    for them to hit the sii.  the more brood, the better the boost.
  
  Packing Restraints: 
    restraints stop the brood from feeding on equipment/items given to them.
    instead they hoard the items among the brood which acts as a shifting pack
    animal for the Ka'lee warrior.
    
    brood can 'gather' and 'drop' eq for a sii.  weight is shared across # of 
    broodlings with size as modifier.

  Nutrient Plastics: 
    a sii can 'yield' the brood, sacrificing one of them for a small hp/sp heal.  
    something like 20/20 heal so it's not super bs but useful in a pinch.  the
    formsmiths equip the brood with linked explosives that upon psionic 
    detonation turn the brood into a nutrient mist that can be absorbed by the 
    host forms skin.
