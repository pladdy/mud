I, SCIRIEN, THE LORD OF ALL THOSE ANIMALS THAT CAN FLY, THE MASTER OF
THE CLOUDS, AND A DEVOUT SERVANT OF DEUS, RAISETH THESE STONES TO MARK

MY PASSING INTO THIS WORLD, I, WHO WAS GIVEN, BY DEUS, THE GRACE AND
POWER TO PASS BEYOND THE CIRCLES OF MY WORLD, I, WHO WAS BROUGHT HERE,

BY DEUS' WILL, ON THE BACK OF THE SACRED FLYING HORSE, I, WHO CALL
ON YOU, DEUS WILLING, TO HONOUR AND GRACE AND PRAISE THE TRUE LORD

OF THE CIRCLES OF EXISTENCE, AND UTTER THE WORDS THAT BESTOW HIS
GRACE UPON YOU.  GLORY TO DEUS!  GLORIA DEUS!
