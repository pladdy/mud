You read the old scroll:
The end of Murus Faralain comes as the hordes of orc kin overrun the
city above me.  I have put a stasis field into effect over the guild's
underground complex in order that the beasts may not suffer from
inattention whilst we be gone.  When it is safe, and upon my return I
will break the field.  Until that time, the circle at the entrance to
the great hall has been supplied with sufficient gems to feed the stasis
for centuries.  Gods willing I shall have returned long before that
happens or the beasts will go mad or die in captivity and that would be
a most ignoble end to such fine specimens.  I have left this scroll in
case another lord returns before me and has need to restore the stasis.
To restore the stasis it is sufficient that the lord 'draw a circle',
and having four gems in hand, 'recite the scroll'.  All beasts within
the proximity defined by the magi's power will be held in stasis until
the gems are consumed.
