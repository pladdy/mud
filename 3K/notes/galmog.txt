galmog reflects like sauk but not as much.  he also has a lot more hps and
regens more it seems

use sword of wounding
use 3 dmg types to remove synergy

defenase bias 110, try 100 with panic next time

long fight, takes about 800 rounds?

while he's wounded, you can surge out of combat :)

use 'panic' this will heal when pheal doesn't fire (due to hit not being from
mob?)
