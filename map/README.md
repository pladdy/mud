# 3 Kingdoms Map

The map is super helpful for sprinting about and charting your location on 3K.  I use it to mark
items, mobs, death traps, etc.  I use anything from roomnotes, roomnames, and colors to designate
different things.

## Utilities
- **gmap** : takes a string and uses `grep` to search the map for that string.  handy to find
             mobs, items, etc. (think map search)
- **run**  : let's you sprint to different rooms given a 'roomname'.  useful for running between
             areas and bootrunning.
