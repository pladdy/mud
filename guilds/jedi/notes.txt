Notes:

for light jedi build
  go athlete
    use guide saber (green)
    use flurry daggers (purple)
    melee
    h2h

  dathomir melee build?  downside is 20 DS hit to healing/defense...OR purge
  as low as you can go and enjoy
    +2 gfs
    +1 lfs
    +2 melee
    +1 h2h
    lose deflect so probably not worth it.  damage is in the spells and real
    defense is in deflect

for dark side build:
  go sorcerer, always so you can use spells faster and heal quick
  try krath
  could second childhood sith aspirant to lower combat skill reqs
